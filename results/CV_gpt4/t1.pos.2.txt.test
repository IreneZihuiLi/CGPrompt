YESScale space is a theory utilized in computer vision that deals with the observation that objects can be perceived differently depending on the scale of observation. Understanding scale space and how it relates to image representations at different resolutions is prerequisite to grasp the concept of intra-class variability, which refers to variations within the same category of objects due to changes in scale, orientation, lighting, etc. Knowledge of scale space helps in designing algorithms that can account for such variability.

YESCorner detection is a low-level image processing technique, which can be a foundational step in the pipeline of recognizing patterns and features within an image. Face detection often utilizes features, which could be informed by corner detection methods. Therefore, understanding corner detection can be helpful when learning about more complex processes like face detection.
