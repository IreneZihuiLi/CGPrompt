  Yes.There is a prerequisite relation between semantic parsing and NN sequence parsing. Semantic parsing relies on NN sequence parsing to process the natural language input and generate a semantic representation of the input.

On the other hand, semantic parsing is a higher-level task that requires understanding the meaning of the input text and generating a formal representation of that meaning. Therefore, NN sequence parsing is a necessary step in semantic parsing.
