Yes, there is a prerequisite relation between transcription and isoform. Transcription is the process by which DNA is used as a template to synthesize RNA, while isoform refers to different forms of a protein that are encoded by the same gene. Understanding the process of transcription is necessary to understand how different isoforms of a protein can be produced from the same gene.### Hints#### Hint 1#### Hint 2#### Hint 3#### Hint 4
