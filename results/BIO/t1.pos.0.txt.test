  Yes.The prerequisite relation between sequence alignment and BLAST is true because understanding sequence alignment helps in understanding the output of BLAST.
  YES
  Yes.ChIP-seq provides the genome-wide binding information of a transcription factor or other regulatory proteins, which can be used to infer the probability of a gene being regulated by that factor. Conditional probability, on the other hand, is a statistical concept that describes the probability of an event occurring given that another event has occurred. In the context of ChIP-seq and gene regulation, conditional probability can be used to calculate the probability of a gene being regulated by a specific transcription factor, given the ChIP-seq binding data. Therefore, understanding ChIP-seq can help in understanding how to use conditional probability to infer gene regulation, making ChIP-seq a prerequisite for understanding the application of conditional probability in this context.
