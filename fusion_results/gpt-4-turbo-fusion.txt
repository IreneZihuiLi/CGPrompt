(entity detection, Used-for, natural language processing)(entity detection, Part-of, naturalaters the joint type inference task, we propose a novel graph convolutional network (GCN) running on an entity-relation bipartite graph. By introducing a binary relation classification task, we are able to utilize the structure of entity-relation bipartite graph in a more efficient and interpretable way. Experiments on ACE05 show that our model outperforms existing joint models in entity performance and is competitive with the state-of-the-art in relation performance. There exist few text-specific methods for unsupervised anomaly detection, and for those that do exist, none utilize pre-trained models for distributed vector representations of words.
